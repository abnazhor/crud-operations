# Crud Operations - Basic Vue.js CRUD app

## Description

CRUD application designed in Vue.js, with Express.js and MongoDB as back-end.

## Requirements

To run this application, you must have already installed on your system the following dependencies:

- MongoDB
- Node.js
- NPM

## Installation

Installation is as easy as it seems:

```bash
cd dist
npm install
```

## Use

Since this app is designed to follow a few requirements, only the port can be changed directly from a file in "dist" folder. To run the application as it has been prepared, you must perform the following steps:

```
npm start
```

And now it will be possible to load the web application on `http://localhost:3000`.
